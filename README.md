  Your assignment for this checkpoint is to complete three drills. Make a new folder in your react-playground project, ./src/state-drills/ to put the component files for these drills in.
  
  An accordion is a website widget that has a stacked list of buttons. Accordions have a purpose similar to tabbed interfaces, showing one item of content at any moment. Accordions place the content between each stacked button and will expand or collapse the content sections in order to reveal them. Users expand or collapse content sections by clicking the appropriate button.
